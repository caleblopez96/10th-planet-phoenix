// STYLING:

[] convert all css to tailwind so i dont have any css files

ROUTING:
[X] add react router and create routes

IMG OPTIMIZATION:
[] convert all images to webp

[] FINISH ADDING FAQ to each page

[X] in nav add active page

[] link all buttons to the proper pages

[] convert all buttons to the component version of itself

[] fix the CTABanner background on lg screens

[] add NavLink to="/About#skills" to my routes but add a top class to the top most element for 2 purposes: so react router scrolls me to top and so that I can have a scroll to top button. (so, put on nav or put on hero?)
