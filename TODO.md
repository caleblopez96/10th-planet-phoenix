add tailwind and convert all css to tailwind so i dont have any css files

HERO:
make gifs of youtube video and try that instead of the pictures
if that doesnt work use black nd white images?

ROUTING:
[X] add react router and create routes
--I got routing working and taken care of for local development but when it comits to github its prob not going to work. im going ot have to tweak the basename of my routing for github pages if i want it to work again. the plan is to complete all sections and have everything working locally, then my project "deployment" stage would be converting all my routes to ensure they work on github pages so I can present my project
