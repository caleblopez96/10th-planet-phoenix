        situation where its entire focus is to continue its own growth.”
      </h3>
      <p className="text-center px-5">
        10th Planet Jiu Jitsu was created by Eddie Bravo under the tutelage of
        Jean Jacques Machado. It is a unique style of no gi Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
        which was made to work both inside the cage and on the sporting mats.
        The intentionality behind the creation was to have an unorthodox style
        which could keep an opponent under constant control and in the threat of
        danger. The 10th Planet system was put to the test in Abu Dhabi 2003,
        and it succeeded masterfully by facilitating Eddie Bravo's victory over
        long time reigning champion Royler Gracie. Immediately following that
        victory, Eddie opened his own school to further the system.
